Problem Statement

● X Education is an organization which provides online course for industry professional. The 
company marks its courses on several popular websites like google.

● The company generates leads through a variety of channels, including website visits, email 
marketing, and social media.

● X Education wants to select most promising leads that can be converted.

● Once a lead is generated, it is assigned a lead score based on a number of factors, such as 
the lead's industry, job title, company size, and level of engagement with X Education's 
content. 

● The lead score is used to prioritize leads and determine which ones should be contacted by 
the sales team.

● The current lead scoring system at X Education is not very effective. The lead conversion rate 
is only around 30%, and the sales team is spending a lot of time on leads that are unlikely to 
convert.

Business Goals 

● The goal of this case study is to build a new lead scoring system that will help X Education 
improve its lead conversion rate.

● Company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as “Hot Leads”

● The new system should be more effective than the current system in identifying leads that are 
most likely to convert. This will allow the sales team to focus their time and resources on the 
most promising leads, resulting in a higher conversion rate.

● The CEO of X Education has set a target lead conversion rate of 80%
